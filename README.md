# E-Commerce-API

In this Bakend project, I initially used Express generator to generate an express application skeleton.
I created routes for for different API endpoints like products,Cart management, Category, User login and signup.
Build RESTFul APIs for all the endpoints to perform CRUD operations.
After setting up routes, I setup connection for my MondoDB database. Used mongoose to communicate with the mongoDB server.
Mongoose enable us to define Schema and structure for our document that are stored in MongoDB database.
After creating schema for Products,cart,user login/signup. I performed CRUD operation on various endpoints.
At last I implemented JSON web tokens for authentication.
